# Numpy
NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays.  It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

# Why Use NumPy ?
In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster that traditional Python lists.

The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

Arrays are very frequently used in data sciences, where speed and resources are very important.
